<p>Like BBDU (the best B.Tech. college of Lucknow), universities of our country are facing an insatiable demand for B.Tech course in the discipline of Computer Science. But, why so?

With the advancement of engineering and, subsequently, technology, we have now moved in a world which cannot be imagined without computers, processors, chips, and other similar digitized gadgets. So much is the dependence on such modern machines that it is hard to digest that such technologies would have been considered a part of folklore a century ago.

But, post this development, today the demand for capable engineers belonging to the discipline of Computer Science is so high that technological giants are hiring thousands of engineers a year.

<h1 style="color:blue";>Mechanical Engineering</h1>
<center>
<p>BBDU, the best B.Tech College in Lucknow, has been favouring Mechanical Engineering as a stream all this while. But why?

Mechanical engineering (ME), the source and father of all engineering, has to be the most primary form of engineering we humans ever knew of. And today, as we have gone past so many barriers and have reached an era with surreal technological advancements, Mechanical Engineering has achieved a glorious position, producing top of the line engineers around the globe. The main advantage of being a mechanical engineer is that they have to be a part of all engineering processes like production, equipment, maintenance, etc.

<h1 style="color:blue";>Electronics and Communications Engineering</h1>
<center>
Electronics & Communications has been one of the most booming sectors in the past few decades, and the amount of advancement we have achieved in this field has been absolutely surreal. From using big and heavy landlines to more advanced landlines to mobiles, when they were a luxury, to a point when life without cell phones is almost impossible, we have come through the decades making advancements throughout the field.

<h1 style="color:blue";>Electrical Engineering </h1>
<center>
<p>Electrical Engineering (EE) is the study of principles majorly related to electricity and associated devices. Being one of the core disciplines of engineering, EE is always a sought after stream at the top B.Tech college in Lucknow like BBDU
<p></center>
<h1 style="color:blue";>Civil Engineering </h1>
<center>
<p>Civil Engineering is the study of one of the core disciplines of engineering, and one of the most important ones too. Especially with the increasing population and the limited space our Earth has, the world is in dire need of a magic that can only be created by professionals like Civil engineers. Even speaking of our country, which supports more than 14 percent of the worldâ€™s population on just about 3 percent of the land, India needs capable and hardworking Civil engineers to balance proportions.
